# Underscourge
Life in the hot and often toxic caverns and tunnels of the undercity is hard and unpredictable. You could leave, and people do, but the allure of the gleaming city above has a hold on people. There's money and power to be had, and in theory one can gain both through a combination of hard work and luck. But if so, you've never seen it happen. No, you and your companions remain in this fetid undercity, where you started at an early age venturing out into the tunnels to hunt, into the landfills to scavenge for useful items. To the extent you're even acknowledged by those in the overcity, it is because of your usefulness to them. The most you can hope for is stable employment in one of the Conclave Houses above, but how much of yourself are you willing to sacrifice to get there?

Most people in the Underscourge fall into one of two categories: working stiffs or the riffraff. The working stiffs hold down regular jobs, some commuting into the overcity to work in fancy restaurants; serve as housecleaners, maids, nannies, and butlers; work in the hydroponics farms; perform various building, mining, and manual labor tasks; seek access to one of the more specialized trades in the overcity, a nearly impossible undertaking; or work directly in one of the Conclave Houses. They take jobs in the overcity that the manicured inhabitants of the Conclave Houses won't take. 

But you're not a working stiff. You're what they call the riffraff. You're not afraid of hard work, mind. Far from it. But a life of wage earning and the soul-grinding that comes along with it was never in the cards for you. You're not just willing to get your hands dirty, you're willing to get them bloody if the price is right. You're the mercs and the hired hands, the hunters and the nightlife, the people who haunt the dangerous passages, selling your sword or your spells to those who can pay, or taking from those who don't want to. Even the gods play mercenary down here. You sign on to the private armies of the Underguilds, themselves bankrolled by the Conclave Houses. You sneak around the city on the hunt for valuable information, and you take care of problems. Dirty work is your business, and in the perpetual gaslight gloom of the undercity, business is always good.

But the Conclave Houses don't make it too easy. Moral panic sweeps like waves over the inhabitants of the overcity, and Scourge Enforcers (all of whom are, or were, regular riffraff like you) regularly come through in their heavy riot armor and round up anyone who looks at them funny, all in the name of clamping down on crime. The best players of undercity factional politics make it their business to know what's coming and when, either because they engineered the situation, or because they pay top dacite, and they can

*Underscourge* is a subterranean game and campaign setting that offers a combination of new and old-school TTRPG play. Its main questions are "what if cyberpunk, but fantasy?" As such, it deals with both regular fantasy themes and the grim/grittier aspects of highly stratified, oppressed societies. While the rules and procedures detailed here

## Character Creation
Basic steps
1. Choose or roll (1d8) a kin
2. Choose or roll (1d..) a class
3. Roll ability pools (6 + 2d6)

### Kin
Principal types of sentient folk in *Underscourge*.

#### Humans
Baseline kin. Most people you meet are humans.

#### Drakken
Claim to be descended from the dragons of old, but there aren't any dragons around to ask.

#### Gnothon
Fungal, weird. Love to make and destroy.

#### Hollowkin
Construct people. Wicker and brass.

#### Sidhe
Elves, if their legends are correct. Long-lived and disconnected from reality. Mad, if you ask some.

#### Stonekin
They look like stone. They're tough as stone. Patient, too. Maybe they are stone.

#### Tusker

### Classes
Classes are collections of [Actions](#taking-actions) and [Equipment](#items-and-equipment). In some cases 

### Underguilds


## Actions
Actions are things your character knows how to do. Each action defines any prerequisites, the ability pool used, equipment necessary to take the action, success/failure conditions, the number of successes necessary to succeed, the speed of the action, and the range and duration of the Action's effects.

Some actions are accessible only as Class features, meaning a character must have trained in that class to access them. Some are Kin-specific and require natural or cultural equipment possessed by that Kin to access them. Of the remaining actions, most can be used with no special training.

Most actions can be trained or improved. Training and improvement provide extra dice you can use for the Action without having to spend extr Action Points. Training costs time, money, and requires a trainer. Improvement requires using your actions and succeeding. See [Advancement]() for more details.

### Magic
Magic is a special category of Actions. All magic must be trained to use, since it requires study, meditation, or some other knoweldge or ritual based means of unlocking esoteric energies. 

### Artifice

## Items and Equipment



## Procedures

### Time, Distance, and Movement
#### Time Scales
* Encounter Round: About ten seconds. Enough time to move one encounter zone and perform an encounter action.
* Exploration Turn: About ten minutes. Enough time to move one exploration zone and perform an exploratoin action.
* Watch: About two hours. Enough time to move one march zone and perform a march action, or enough time to perform a watch action. Watch actions depend on the [Phase](#phases).


#### Distance
* Encounter Zone: About 40 feet, depending on terrain and obstacles.
* Exploration Zone: One room, chamber, or city district.
* Watch: About six miles, depending on terrain and obstacles.
* March: 

### Taking Actions

#### Action Speed
Actions occur at different resolution scales (see [Time and Movement](#time-and-movement)). Encounter-scale actions take place within one or more turns or rounds during an Encounter Phase. Exploration-scale actions take place within one or more turns during an Exploration Phase. March-scale and Camp-scale actions take place within one or more watches during a March or Camp Phase. And Downtime-scale actions happen during one or more days of a Downtime Phase.

#### Phases
Encounter Phase: Whenever you need to keep strict track of things happening within seconds, where the order matters, etc., you are in an Encounter Phase. 

### Advancement
Advancement in *Underscourge* works a bit differently from other games. In *Underscourge*, characters advance by picking up new equipment, learning how to do new things, or by getting better at what they already know how to do. They also advance by improving their standing with their Underguild. Training and Action Impovement are detailed here. Underguild Advancement is covered in the [Underguilds](#underguilds) section.

#### Action Training
Costs 1000 dacites for each training level you will have after completing the training (e.g., training from level 1 to 2 costs 2000 dacites.) Takes 1d4 weeks. Requires a trainer (anyone whose training level is at least one greater than what you have when you start the training.) Occurs only during Downtime Phase.

#### Action Improvement
Whenever you use an Action that can be improved, and you either critically succeed or critically fail, place a tick next to the Action. The next time you are in a Downtime phase, for each tick mark you have next to an Action, roll a d6. If any d6 exceeds your current training level in that Action, increase your training level by 1. No Action can exceed 6 levels of training.

### Combat
Diplomacy by other means.

#### Initiative
Used to determine in what order something happens. Usually applicable only to Encounters, especially combat.

### Conditions
Things that can temporarily reduce a character's efficacy. Cleared through healing and some [rests](#rests).

### Damage, Death, and Recovery

#### Armor and Defenses

### Rests
* Encounter-scale rest (3/day): 1 round, during which you can fully replenish one action pool.
* Exploration-scale rest (1/day): 1 turn, during which you can fully replenish one action pool.
